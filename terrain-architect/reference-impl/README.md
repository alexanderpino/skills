# Reference implementations

Runnable, **numpy-only, pytest-verified** mirrors of the simulation pseudocode in the
`terrain-architect` references. Every module is small and reads like its pseudocode block;
every module ships a test that asserts the *exact oracle* the skill's verification chapter
(`09-verification.md`) already specifies for it. Nothing here is production code — it exists
so a reader can **run the skill's own algorithms and watch `09`'s checks pass**, and so the
claims in the references are executable rather than merely asserted.

This repository currently provides no separate licence grant for these files. Treat them as
executable evidence, not code that may automatically be copied into a product. Engine
implementations consume the neutral pseudocode, grounding decisions and oracles from the
references; any reuse of repository code requires an applicable project licence or explicit
permission.

## Run

```bash
cd terrain-architect/reference-impl
pip install -r requirements.txt      # numpy, pytest
pytest -q                            # 129 pass; 15 optional checks skip (see below)

# optional independent checks (validity evidence beyond the numpy-only oracles):
pip install -r requirements-crossvalidate.txt   # RichDEM/pysheds/Landlab -> 5 cross-validation tests
pip install -r requirements-validate.txt        # pint -> 10 dimensional-consistency tests
pytest -q                            # 144 pass; all optional checks now run
```

## What's here, and how each is verified

The verification design is **layered**: use the strongest oracle available per algorithm —
a closed-form value where one exists, otherwise `09`'s invariants (determinism, no NaN, mass
conservation, radial symmetry) and quantitative signatures, plus an optional cross-check
against an independent library.

**On what "verified" means here:** most oracles prove the code *solves the stated equation
correctly* (internal consistency), not that the equation is *right* (validity). The evidence
that separates the two — dimensional consistency, independent-library agreement, published
benchmarks, primary-source audit — is tracked in **`VALIDATION.md`**.

A *look*, not oracle-verified |
| `crater_anatomy.py` — grazing anatomy figure | labels the corrected grazing morphology | map + trajectory cross-section → `crater_anatomy.png`: deeper up-range floor, up-range forbidden rim, transverse butterfly wings, downrange ejecta. Needs Pillow for the labels (terrain is numpy-only) |
| `sims_illustrative.py` — **⚠ illustrative** sims | `12`/`19` lava CA, SIA glacier, coastal cliff retreat, tides | **INVARIANTS ONLY, no decisive oracle** — lava conserves mass (erupted = molten + frozen), glacier transport conserves ice & H ≥ 0, coastal erosion removes mass monotonically, tide bounded & solid untouched. Sketches to watch move, **not** verified numbers |
| `archetypes.py` — **province** compositions | `20` — **16** archetypes across Groups A–L as diffs from the baseline (alpine, appalachian, canyon, mesa, erg, basin&range, badlands, tower karst, stratovolcano, caldera, fjord, sea cliffs, ag terraces, lunar cratered, maria, mars) | one recognisable *place* per tile, dominant agent switched; each carries its `09` signature; **labelled** montage → `archetypes.png` (full coverage ledger incl. what's *not* renderable in `ARCHETYPES.md`). Resolution-parametric; tier L — compositions, not new algorithms |
| `screen_worlds.py` — **screen worlds** | `20` "Screen worlds": 8 fictional planets as re-dressed archetypes (Arrakis, Monument Valley, Pandora, Hoth, Skull Island, Beggar's Canyon, Crait, Miller's world) | each names its real filming location + the archetype it decomposes to; only the *dressing* (render / sea level / material) changes → `screen_worlds.png` |

## Sandbox: run a graph and look at it

The modules above are *nodes*; `graph_demo.py` is a tiny sandbox that wires them into a
**terrain graph** you can run and render — the place to drop a new algorithm in during
development and actually see what it does. It has no dependencies beyond the numpy the rest
of `reference-impl` already needs.

```bash
python graph_demo.py                          # droplet backbone, 96² -> eight PNGs in out/
python graph_demo.py --backbone streampower --size 128 --extent-km 120
python graph_demo.py --noise ridged           # base noise family (01): perlin/value/ridged/hybrid/warp
python graph_demo.py --seed 7 --sun-sweep 8   # rotating-light frames (09's sun sweep)
python graph_demo.py --cache-demo             # watch the content-addressed cache
```

Two files, both deliberately small:

- **`graph_demo.py`** — a scale model of the substrate in `14-graph-runtime.md`: nodes are
  pure `fn(params, inputs, ctx)` functions with a declared locality
  (LOCAL / NEIGHBOURHOOD / GLOBAL) and preview class, edges are world-space fields, and the
  DAG is **content-addressed cached** (change one node, only its downstream cone recomputes —
  that is what makes it usable for iteration). The sample pipeline walks the **Legal Order**:
  fBm noise → fluvial erosion (droplet < 2 km, stream power > 50 km, per the design
  procedure) → thermal *after* hydraulic → depression fill → drainage area → slope → masks →
  materials → scatter, with all analysis computed on the **final** geometry. It prints the `09`
  checks it should pass (trunk drainage exits at the edge; slope capped at the repose angle; the
  erosion budget).
- **`render.py`** — the `09` "visual review modes" as pure-numpy functions returning RGB
  arrays, plus a zero-dependency PNG writer: greyscale height, hillshade, slope shade,
  `log(A)` flow overlay, hypsometric tint, a false-colour clip that flags NaN/Inf, a
  material splatmap (partitioned `06` masks blended by weight), a boulder scatter overlay, and
  the **photoreal composite** (`sun_sky_shade` + `photoreal`: material colour × sun+sky ×
  ambient occlusion + rivers + aerial perspective — Stage 1 of `HYPERREALISM.md`, the render
  behind both montages). Import it directly to render any heightfield from the other modules.

The base node normalises the chosen `01` noise family to [0,1] for the demo, but the noise
itself is the verified `noise.py` module (noise is the initial condition, not the answer).
Everything downstream is a thin adapter over the verified modules; `tests/test_graph_demo.py`
checks the wiring, the cache, and the `09` invariants. For a by-eye pass over **every**
algorithm on one shared base — the visual complement to the oracles, with a numeric range trace
that catches blow-ups the normalised renders hide — run `python gallery.py` (see `GALLERY.md`).
For
where each node comes from — reference library, pinned revision, licence, grounding state and
which cross-check covers it — see **`GROUNDING.md`**. For how far these tiles could be pushed
toward photoreal — the shared render pipeline (Stage 1, now driving both montages), the
per-archetype geomorphology each landform still needs, and where the numpy sandbox honestly tops
out — see **`HYPERREALISM.md`**.

## Coverage boundary and production paths

- **These modules are executable specifications, not production dependencies.** Port the
  paper-derived contracts and `09` oracles into the engine's own C++, Rust, C#, HLSL or compute
  stack. Landlab, fastscapelib, RichDEM and pysheds are useful independent comparison targets when
  project policy permits test-only dependencies; **RichDEM, pysheds and Landlab are wired** as
  cross-validation here (fastscapelib is not) — RichDEM/pysheds for the flow ops
  (`tests/test_crossvalidate.py`) and Landlab (MIT) for stream power, D8 accumulation and hillslope
  diffusion (`tests/test_crossvalidate_landlab.py`). See `GROUNDING.md` for the node-by-node map.
- **D-infinity** (Tarboton 1997) — implement from the paper when needed. The D8/MFD pair here
  demonstrates the single-receiver-artefact vs dispersive contrast and supplies shared fixtures.
- **The pipe sediment/erosion coupling** — the water solver (where the documented NaN failure
  lives) is the verified core; implement the transport-capacity + semi-Lagrangian advection layer
  from `04` and validate mass conservation before moving it to the GPU.
- **The un-oracled sims** (coastal cliff retreat, tides, the lava CA, the transient SIA glacier)
  have **no decisive deterministic oracle** — so they live in `sims_illustrative.py`, segregated
  and held only to *invariants* (finite, mass/energy budget, monotone trends). They are sketches
  you can run and watch, **not** verified numbers; validate against real morphometry before any
  use. **Learned / ML synthesis** stays out entirely (frontier, unstable metadata).
